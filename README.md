# 🎃 Haunted Couture - Slideware Prototype

This repository contains the **Haunted Couture** prototype, built as a **slideware prototype** for rapid UX exploration. The application imagines a Halloween-themed online fashion platform where users can upload their photos, virtually try on outfits, shop for themed clothing, and share creations on social media.

📌 This project was approached as a full UX case study, from concept and storyboarding to slideware prototyping, user testing, and iteration.

## 📝 What is Slideware in UI/UX?

In the context of UI/UX and **rapid prototyping**, *slideware* refers to prototypes created using presentation tools (PowerPoint, Google Slides, etc.) rather than code.  

- **Purpose:** Quickly simulate screens, flows, and interactions without development overhead.  
- **Speed:** Faster than high-fidelity prototyping tools; ideal for early testing and feedback.  
- **Use Cases:** Storyboarding flows, demonstrating navigation, mimicking interaction patterns, and presenting usability scenarios.  

Slideware prototypes help UX designers validate concepts early in the process, saving time and resources before committing to high-fidelity design or engineering.

## 📖 Case Study Overview

**Inspiration & Problem Space:**  
Seasonal and themed shopping experiences (like Halloween fashion) often lack interactivity. Shoppers can’t easily visualize outfits, test combinations, or share their creativity.  

**Goal:**  
Design a platform that makes Halloween shopping engaging and interactive through photo uploads, virtual try-ons, AI-assisted styling, and social media sharing.  

**Solution:**  
We prototyped **Haunted Couture**, a Halloween-inspired online fashion experience, using slideware. The prototype demonstrates core features such as uploading personal photos, searching for items, trying on outfits virtually, and sharing styled looks with friends.

## 🎯 Key Tasks Prototyped

1. **Submit Pictures**  
   - Upload an image from a device or take a photo with a webcam  
   - Manage photos in a gallery with navigation via a slider  

2. **Search for Fashion Items**  
   - Keyword-based search (such as "witch")  
   - Add themed items to a basket by size and type  

3. **Virtual Fitting Room**  
   - Apply basket items onto a user's uploaded photo  
   - Toggle clothing on/off and save outfits with custom names  

4. **Sharing & Social Media Integration**  
   - Share styled outfits with preview options  
   - Enable star ratings and/or comments  
   - Generate sharable links with buttons for Email, Twitter (X), Instagram, and Meta

## 🧩 Design Elements & Patterns

- **Interactive Components:** sliders, checkboxes, radio buttons, modals, text inputs, action buttons  
- **Patterns Used:**  
  - Visual framework for consistent navigation  
  - Module tabs and navigation bars  
  - Progressive disclosure in sharing flows  
  - Cards and collections for displaying items and outfits  
  - Modal panels for confirmations and previews

## 👥 User Testing & Findings

We conducted usability studies with multiple participants. Key observations included:  

- **Navigation Issues:** Users sometimes overlooked clickable elements like "My Basket" or misunderstood drag-and-drop areas.  
- **Feedback & Confirmation:** Participants wanted more status updates, such as confirmation modals when uploading images or adding items.  
- **Terminology & Labels:** Button text (like "Share Outfit") occasionally caused confusion; clearer labels improved task success.  
- **Accessibility & Inclusivity:** Feedback suggested naming outfits for easier recognition and using toggles familiar to mobile UI conventions.  

**Lessons Learned:**  
- Never assume affordances are obvious; clarity matters.  
- Redundant navigation (icon + button) improves usability.  
- Inclusive design (labels, naming, accessibility) makes prototypes more realistic.

## 📊 Fidelity & Inspirations

- **Information Design:** Medium fidelity (consistent layout and navigation, but limited scope)  
- **Interaction Design:** High fidelity (click-through flows, multiple task paths, functional interactivity)  
- **Visual Branding:** High fidelity (distinct Halloween theme, cohesive palette, styled components)  
- **Editorial Content:** High fidelity (realistic descriptions and outfit examples)  

**Inspirations:** Google Shopping, H&M, and other online retail sites with filters, basket interactions, and social integrations.
